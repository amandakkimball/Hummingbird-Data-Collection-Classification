# Hummingbird-Data-Collection-Classification
The purpose of this project is to create an image classification for hummingbird species and genders that visit feeders in Colorado. (It is applicable to anywhere that hummingbirds migrate or breed given additional datasets for those species.) The ultimate goal is to have a classification system that can be deployed at any feeder. This is important to the continued monitoring of hummingbird species and migration patterns. Humming bird migration is otherwise reliant on individual bird watchers to see and report their observations. If avid bird lovers setup a similar system, then conservation organizations would have better information on migratory and breeding patterns. This knowledge can be used to determine if specific changes in the environment or ecology has positively or negatively impacted bird life.
