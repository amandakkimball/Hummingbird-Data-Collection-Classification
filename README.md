# Hummingbird-Data-Collection-Classification
This repository is a work in progress.  It will eventually hold the code used for data scraping from the web, data scraping from my hummingbird camera, image pre-processing for the data set, code for a binary (male/female) bird classifier, code for a species classifier, and finally it will hold a model that can be used to predict future bird images...
